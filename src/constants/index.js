    question: "What are the key steps in the loan approval process?",
    answer:
      "Approval of loan is at the sole discretion of the loan sanctioning officer who bases his/her decision on the basis of the criteria specified by the bank/ financial institution. The entire process can take from about 48 hours to about two week's time. Once all the necessary documents are submitted and the verification process is completed, the loan, if sanctioned, is disbursed within seven working days by the bank. In order to avoid delays in loan processing and disbursement, do keep all necessary documents ready along with the post dated checks (PDC) and/or signed Electronic Clearing System form.",
